# Indoor Environment Monitoring System Using Arduino: co2, temperature and pressure

Version: 0.1

This project is based on other Arduino projects by [Alex Gyver (RU)](https://github.com/AlexGyver/MeteoClock) and [Norovl (RU)](https://github.com/Norovl/meteoClock). All comments are still in Russuan but I'm going to translate it later

This firmware uses 1602 screen with big numbers as sensor values. In addition it has a Buzzer which plays melody once CO2 level reaches unhealthy value. There is also a Mute switch to switch off all sounds.
